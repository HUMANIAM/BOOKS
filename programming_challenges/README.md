# Programming Challenges
I read this book end to end and solved every single problem on it by passing [UVa](https://onlinejudge.org/) judge system.

### Motivations
- Problem solving one of the methods to keep programming everyday.
- Reviewing the basics of algorithms and data structures.
- Preparing myself for technical interviews.
- Sometimes, It just was `I wanna read something.`.

### Chapters
- *Get Started*
    - the structure of the book.
    - basic problems, mainly array-based problems.
