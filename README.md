# BOOKS
This is a list of books I read and am reading. It could include books in programming languages,
machine learning, algorithms and data structures, web development, security, ..... etc.

`for me, learning by reading and applying what I read is a good way to get better on the topic I am intersted in.`

I just publish them on github to share my notes and solutions with people who may find it useful.
